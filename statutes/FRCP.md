## Rule 3. Commencing An Action

A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court. 

## Rule 7. Pleadings Allowed; Form of Motions and Other Papers

(a) Pleadings. Only these pleadings are allowed:

> (1) a complaint;

> (2) an answer to a complaint;

> (3) an answer to a counterclaim designated as a counterclaim;

> (4) an answer to a crossclaim;

> (5) a third-party complaint;

> (6) an answer to a third-party complaint; and

> (7) if the court orders one, a reply to an answer. 

(b) Motions and Other Papers. 

> (1) In General. A request for a court order must be made by motion. The motion must:

> > (A) be in writing unless made during a hearing or trial;

> > (B) state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order; and

> > (C) state the relief sought. 

> (2) Form. The rules governing captions and other matters of form in pleadings apply to motions and other papers. 

## Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading

(a) Claim for Relief. A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:

> (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;

> (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and

> (3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief. 

(b) Defenses; Admissions and Denials. 

> (1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must:

> > (A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it; and

> > (B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party. 

> (2) Denials—Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation. 

> (3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictional grounds—may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted. 

> (4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest. 

> (5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial. 

> (6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided. 

(c) Affirmative Defenses. 

> (1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:
>
> • accord and satisfaction;
> • arbitration and award;
> • assumption of risk;
> • contributory negligence;
> • duress;
> • estoppel;
> • failure of consideration;
> • fraud;
> • illegality;
> • injury by fellow servant;
> • laches;
> • license;
> • payment;
> • release;
> • res judicata;
> • statute of frauds;
> • statute of limitations; and
> • waiver. 

> (2) Mistaken Designation. If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so. 

(d) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Alternative Statements; Inconsistency. 

> (1) In General. Each allegation must be simple, concise, and direct. No technical form is required. 

> (2) Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense. A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient. 

> (3) Inconsistent Claims or Defenses. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency. 

(e) Construing Pleadings. Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice. 

## Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters

[ * * * ]

(b) Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to the Court; Sanctions

(a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney’s name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer’s address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a Rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney’s or party’s attention. 

(b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:

> (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;

> (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;

> (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and

> (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information. 

(c) Sanctions. 

> (1) In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee. 

> (2) Motion for Sanctions. A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred for the motion. 

> (3) On the Court’s Initiative. On its own, the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b). 

> (4) Nature of a Sanction. A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation. 

> (5) Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not impose a monetary sanction:

> > (A) against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b) (2); or

> > (B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned. 

> (6) Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the sanction. 

(d) Inapplicability to Discovery. This rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions under Rules 26 through 37. 

## Rule 12. Defenses and Objections: When and How Presented; Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings; Consolidating Motions; Waiving Defenses; Pretrial Hearing

(a) Time to Serve a Responsive Pleading. [***]

(b) How to Present Defenses. Every defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion:

> (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;

> (2) lack of personal jurisdiction;

> (3) improper venue;

> (4) insufficient process;

> (5) insufficient service of process;

> (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and

> (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19. 

A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion. 

[ * * * ]

(e) Motion for a More Definite Statement. A party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order. 

(f) Motion to Strike. The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act:

> (1) on its own; or

> (2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 20 days after being served with the pleading. 

(g) Joining Motions. 

> (1) Right to Join. A motion under this rule may be joined with any other motion allowed by this rule. 

> (2) Limitation on Further Motions. Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion. 

(h) Waiving and Preserving Certain Defenses. 

> (1) When Some Are Waived. A party waives any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(2)-(5) by:

> > (A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances described in Rule 12(g) (2); or

> > (B) failing to either:

	> > (i) make it by motion under this rule; or
	> > (ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course. 

> (2) When to Raise Others. Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:

> > (A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);

> > (B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or

> > (C) at trial. 

> (3) Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action. 

(i) Hearing Before Trial. If a party so moves, any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(1)-(7)—whether made in a pleading or by motion—and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial. 

## Rule 13. Counterclaim and Crossclaim

(a) Compulsory Counterclaim. 

> (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:

> > (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim; and

> > (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. 

> (2) Exceptions. The pleader need not state the claim if:

> > (A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the subject of another pending action; or

> > (B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or other process that did not establish personal jurisdiction over the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any counterclaim under this rule. 

(b) Permissive Counterclaim. A pleading may state as a counterclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not compulsory. 

(c) Relief Sought in a Counterclaim. A counterclaim need not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from the relief sought by the opposing party. 

[ * * * ]

(g) Crossclaim Against a Coparty. A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant. 

(h) Joining Additional Parties. Rules 19 and 20 govern the addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 14. Third-Party Practice

(a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. 

> (1) Timing of the Summons and Complaint. A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court’s leave if it files the third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer. 

> (2) Third-Party Defendant’s Claims and Defenses. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint—the “third-party defendant”:

> > (A) must assert any defense against the third-party plaintiff’s claim under Rule 12;

> > (B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);

> > (C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff’s claim; and

> > (D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff. 

> (3) Plaintiff’s Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant. The plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any defense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g). 

> (4) Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately. 

> (5) Third-Party Defendant’s Claim Against a Nonparty. A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it. 

[ * * * ]
 
(b) When a Plaintiff May Bring in a Third Party. When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings

(a) Amendments Before Trial. 

> (1) Amending as a Matter of Course. A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within:

> > (A) 21 days after serving it, or 

> > (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.

> (2) Other Amendments. In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires. 

> (3) Time to Respond. Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an amended pleading must be made within the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever is later. 

[ * * * ]

(c) Relation Back of Amendments. 

> (1) When an Amendment Relates Back. An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:

> > (A) the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back;

> > (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading; or

> > (C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:

> > > (i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and

> > > (ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party’s identity. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 18. Joinder of Claims

(a) In General. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party. 

(b) Joinder of Contingent Claims. A party may join two claims even though one of them is contingent on the disposition of the other; but the court may grant relief only in accordance with the parties’ relative substantive rights. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to set aside a conveyance that is fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first obtaining a judgment for the money. 

## Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties

(a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible. 

> (1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:

> > (A) in that person’s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or

> > (B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person’s absence may:

> > > (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability to protect the interest; or

> > > (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest. 

> (2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. 

> (3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party. 

(b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:

> (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person’s absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;

> (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:

> > (A) protective provisions in the judgment;

> > (B) shaping the relief; or

> > (C) other measures;

> (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person’s absence would be adequate; and

> (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder. 

(c) Pleading the Reasons for Nonjoinder. When asserting a claim for relief, a party must state:

> (1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be joined if feasible but is not joined; and

> (2) the reasons for not joining that person. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 20. Permissive Joinder of Parties

(a) Persons Who May Join or Be Joined. 

> (1) Plaintiffs. Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if:

> > (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and

> > (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action. 

> (2) Defendants. Persons—as well as a vessel, cargo, or other property subject to admiralty process in rem—may be joined in one action as defendants if:

> > (A) any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and

> > (B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action. 

> (3) Extent of Relief. Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant need be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. The court may grant judgment to one or more plaintiffs according to their rights, and against one or more defendants according to their liabilities. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 21. Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties

Misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action. On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party. 

## Rule 22. Interpleader

(a) Grounds.

> (1) By a Plaintiff. Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though: 

> > (A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or

> > (B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.

> (2) By a Defendant. A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim. 

(b) Relation to Other Rules and Statutes. This rule supplements—and does not limit—the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The remedy this rule provides is in addition to—and does not supersede or limit—the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. §§1335, 1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.

## Rule 24. Intervention

(a) Intervention of Right. On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who:

> (1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

> (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest. 

(b) Permissive Intervention. 

> (1) In General. On timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who:

> > (A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

> > (B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact. 

[ * * * ]

> (3) Delay or Prejudice. In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights. 

[ * * * ]

## Rule 56. Summary Judgment

(a) By a Claiming Party. A party claiming relief may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim.

(b) By a Defending Party. A party against whom relief is sought may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment

(c) Procedures. 

> (1) Supporting Factual Positions. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: 

> > (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or

> > (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. 

> (2) Objection That a Fact Is Not Supported by Admissible Evidence. A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.

> (3) Materials Not Cited. The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.

> (4) Affidavits or Declarations. An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.

[ * * * ]


(d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on the Motion.

> (1) Establishing Facts. If summary judgment is not rendered on the whole action, the court should, to the extent practicable, determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue. The court should so determine by examining the pleadings and evidence before it and by interrogating the attorneys. It should then issue an order specifying what facts — including items of damages or other relief — are not genuinely at issue. The facts so specified must be treated as established in the action.

> (2) Establishing Liability. An interlocutory summary judgment may be rendered on liability alone, even if there is a genuine issue on the amount of damages.

[ * * * ]
