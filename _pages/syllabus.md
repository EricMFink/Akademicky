Topics to be covered include underworld governance, employment of demons, infliction of spiritual distress, sales and leases of souls, and the ethics of representing the Devil. This course is intended to prepare you for practice as a Devil's advocate by developing the knowledge and skill required to recognize and analyze legal issues, advise your client about those issues and available options, negotiate on behalf of your client in transactions, and advocate for your client in litigation. 

# Required Materials
