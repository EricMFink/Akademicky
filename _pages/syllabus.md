# Description

In this course, you will learn about the difficulties of practicing law. This course is intended to prepare you for legal practice by developing the knowledge and skill required to recognize and analyze legal issues, advise your client about those issues and available options, negotiate on behalf of your client in transactions, and advocate for your client in litigation.

# Required Materials

# Policies

### Grading

Your final grade for the term will be based on unit quizzes (40% total) and a final exam (60%).

### Attendance

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses:

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.

Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of your grade.

### Disability Accommodations
