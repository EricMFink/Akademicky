# Description

In this course, you will learn about the procedures for civil suits. Topics to be covered include the scope of a lawsuit, selection of an appropriate forum, presentation of claims and defenses, choice of applicable law, disposition without a trial, and the effect of judgments on future litigation. Other aspects of civil litigation (e.g., discovery, trials, & appeals) are covered in upper-level elective courses. While the course will focus on federal courts, the rules of civil procedure in many states (including North Carolina) are similar. 

This course is intended to prepare you for legal practice by developing the knowledge and skill required to recognize and analyze procedural issues, advise clients on those issues and the available options, and to draft pleadings and pre-trial motions.

Cases, statutes, rules, and other assigned readings (see "Schedule & Assignments") are available online via the course site [`emfink.net/CivilProcedure`](https://www.emfink.net/CivilProcedure).

### Class Preparation, Attendance, & Participation

Successful performance in this course depends on completion of all reading assignments before class, regular and prompt class attendence, and constructive engagement during class.
