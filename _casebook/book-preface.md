# Preface

This book presents judicial opinions, statutes and regulations, and other material pertaining to the law governing employment and labor relations.  Topics covered include establishing an employment relationship; recruitment & hiring; supervisory control and employee autonomy; confidentiality & competition; wages & hours; employee health & workplace injuries; termination of employment; and arbitration of employment disputes.

Most of the materials reproduced here are in the public domain; excerpts from copyrighted materials are included for teaching purposes under the fair use doctrine. Materials have been redacted to omit passages not pertinent to the learning objectives. Judicial opinions have also been "cleaned up" for ease of reading.[^Preface1] 

[^Preface1]: _See_ Jack Metzler, [Cleaning Up Quotations](https://lawrepository.ualr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1405&context=appellatepracticeprocess), 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 143, 154 (2017) (proposing "cleaned up" parenthetical for quotations from judicial opinions, to indicate the author “has removed extraneous, non-substantive material like brackets, quotation marks, ellipses, footnote reference numbers, and internal citations; may have changed capitalization without using brackets to indicate that change; and affirmatively represents that the alterations were made solely to enhance readability and that the quotation otherwise faithfully reproduces the quoted text.”) 

##### Sidenotes & Margin Notes

Following the typographical style of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), this site uses sidenotes and margin notes in place of traditional footnotes or endnotes. These appear in the right-hand margin, avoiding the need to jump through hyperlinks or scroll to the note text. Numbered sidenotes[^sidenote] are used for footnotes in the source materials (with original note numbering indicated in parentheses). Unnumbered margin notes,[^marginnote] in <span class="sans-green">green sans-serif typeface</span>, are used for editor's comments. 

[^sidenote]: This is an example of a sidenote. 

[^marginnote]: 
  {-} This is an example of a margin note.
