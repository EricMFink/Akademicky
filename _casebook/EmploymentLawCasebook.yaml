  abstract: >-
    Why our workplaces are authoritarian private governments-and why we can't
    see it   One in four American workers says their workplace is a
    "dictatorship." Yet that number probably would be even higher if we
    recognized most employers for what they are-private governments with
    sweeping authoritarian power over our lives, on duty and off. We normally
    think of government as something only the state does, yet many of us are
    governed far more-and far more obtrusively-by the private government of the
    workplace. In this provocative and compelling book, Elizabeth Anderson
    argues that the failure to see this stems from long-standing confusions.
    These confusions explain why, despite all evidence to the contrary, we still
    talk as if free markets make workers free-and why so many employers advocate
    less government even while they act as dictators in their businesses.   In
    many workplaces, employers minutely regulate workers' speech, clothing, and
    manners, leaving them with little privacy and few other rights. And
    employers often extend their authority to workers' off-duty lives. Workers
    can be fired for their political speech, recreational activities, diet, and
    almost anything else employers care to govern. Yet we continue to talk as if
    early advocates of market society-from John Locke and Adam Smith to Thomas
    Paine and Abraham Lincoln-were right when they argued that it would free
    workers from oppressive authorities. That dream was shattered by the
    Industrial Revolution, but the myth endures.    *Private Government*  offers
    a better way to talk about the workplace, opening up space for discovering
    how workers can enjoy real freedom.   Based on the prestigious Tanner
    Lectures delivered at Princeton University's Center for Human Values,
    *Private Government*  is edited and introduced by Stephen Macedo and
    includes commentary by cultural critic David Bromwich, economist Tyler
    Cowen, historian Ann Hughes, and philosopher Niko Kolodny.

  abstract: >-
    Scholars and other commentators widely assert that enforcement of
    contractual and other limitations on labor mobility deters innovation. Based
    on this view, federal and state legislators have taken, and continue to
    consider, actions to limit the enforcement of covenants not to compete in
    employment agreements. These actions would discard the centuries-old
    reasonableness standard that governs the enforcement of these provisions,
    often termed “noncompetes,” in all but four states (notably, California). We
    argue that this zero-enforcement position lacks a sound basis in theory or
    empirics. As a matter of theory, it overlooks the complex effects of
    contractual limitations on labor mobility in innovation markets. While it is
    frequently asserted that noncompetes may impede knowledge spillovers that
    foster innovation, it is frequently overlooked that noncompetes may
    encourage firms to invest in cultivating intellectual and human capital. As
    a matter of empirics, we show that two commonly referenced bodies of
    evidence fail to support zero enforcement. First, we revisit the
    conventional account of the rise of Silicon Valley and the purported fall of
    the Boston area as innovation centers, showing that this divergence cannot
    suitably be explained by differences in state law regarding noncompetes.
    Second, we show that widely cited empirical studies fail to support a causal
    relationship between noncompetes, reduced labor mobility, and reduced
    innovation. Given these theoretical and empirical complexities, we propose
    an error-cost approach that provides an economic rationale for the common
    law’s reasonableness approach toward contractual constraints on the
    circulation of human capital.

  abstract: >-
    In the wake of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, many American
    private-sector employers now have the legal right to recruit their workers
    into politics and to fire or discipline employees who refuse to participate.
    How many firms and workers are engaged in this kind of political recruitment
    and why? And how have the opportunities for the political recruitment of
    workers by their employers changed over time? Drawing on national surveys of
    top corporate managers and workers, as well as a review of the legal
    literature, I provide initial answers to these questions and illustrate the
    implications of employer political recruitment for a range of substantive
    and normative issues in American politics. My findings invite further
    research and discussion about this feature of the American workplace and its
    effects on politics and policy.

  abstract: >-
    While federal anti-employment discrimination laws have helped diminish
    inequality at work, discrimination persists, in part perhaps due to unequal
    handling of equal employment lawsuits. Prior research demonstrates that the
    definition of discrimination can vary based on local normative ideas, while
    another line shows that a judge's race or gender can shape how related
    lawsuits are handled. In this article, I draw on a set of EEOC workplace
    discrimination cases prosecuted in Federal Court and combine it with
    locality data, to analyze: (1) the impact of local context, specifically
    rurality, local political context, and southerness and; (2) how judges' race
    and gender interact with the local cultural-milieu. Findings reveal that
    plaintiffs of colour in race discrimination cases fair worse in rural courts
    or before white judges. Meanwhile, white judges in conservative areas are
    more defendant friendly than those outside the in more liberal areas. Black
    judges, in comparison, are more plaintiff friendly in conservative areas
    when compared to black judges in more liberal areas. While female judges are
    generally more plaintiff friendly than male judges in sex cases, location
    has no discernible effect.

    Many significant law and society studies have documented patterns of legal
    mobilization among average people confronting conflict in their daily lives.
    These studies have demonstrated that although legal rights and entitlements
    may be formally available, they are rarely invoked. There can be
    considerable difference between what people are entitled to under law and
    what they actually receive. Thus, this article fits into a long tradition of
    exploring this gap between the law on the books and the law in action, but
    it builds on this tradition by including in the “law in action” the
    meaning-making activities of ordinary women confronting

  abstract: >-
    Contrary to the idea that the United States was liberal from its inception,
    Orren argues that both capitalism and constitutionalism proceeded upon a
    remnant of ancient feudalism. This was the common law of master and servant,
    embedded in the judiciary, cutting off the fundamental area of labor
    governance from democratic politics. The fully legislative polity that
    defines the modern liberal state was brought on through the industrial
    actions of trade unions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
    centuries, and was established with the institutions of collective
    bargaining under the New Deal. The book represents a reinterpertation of
    American political development and of the role of the labor movement as a
    creator of liberalism, not a spoiler of socialism.
