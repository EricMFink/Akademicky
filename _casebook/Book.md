# Preface

This book presents cases and other material for use in a course on the legal process. Topics covered include arbitrary and capricious procedures, cruel and unusual punishment, and devil's advocacy.

Most of the materials reproduced here are in the public domain; excerpts from copyrighted materials are included for teaching purposes under the fair use doctrine. Materials have been redacted to omit passages not pertinent to the learning objectives. Judicial opinions have also been "cleaned up" for ease of reading.[^Preface1] 

[^Preface1]: _See_ Jack Metzler, [Cleaning Up Quotations](https://lawrepository.ualr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1405&context=appellatepracticeprocess), 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 143, 154 (2017) (proposing "cleaned up" parenthetical for quotations from judicial opinions, to indicate the author “has removed extraneous, non-substantive material like brackets, quotation marks, ellipses, footnote reference numbers, and internal citations; may have changed capitalization without using brackets to indicate that change; and affirmatively represents that the alterations were made solely to enhance readability and that the quotation otherwise faithfully reproduces the quoted text.”)
