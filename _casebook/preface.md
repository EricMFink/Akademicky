This book presents material for use in a law school course on the perils and pitfalls of legal practice. Topics covered include representing difficult clients, dealing with vexatious adversaries, and negotiating favorable terms for the sale of your soul.

Most of the materials reproduced here are in the public domain; excerpts from copyrighted materials are included for teaching purposes under the fair use doctrine. Materials have been redacted to omit passages not pertinent to the learning objectives. Judicial opinions have also been "cleaned up" for ease of reading.[^Preface1] 

[^Preface1]: _See_ Jack Metzler, [Cleaning Up Quotations](https://lawrepository.ualr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1405&context=appellatepracticeprocess), 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 143, 154 (2017) (proposing "cleaned up" parenthetical for quotations from judicial opinions, to indicate the author “has removed extraneous, non-substantive material like brackets, quotation marks, ellipses, footnote reference numbers, and internal citations; may have changed capitalization without using brackets to indicate that change; and affirmatively represents that the alterations were made solely to enhance readability and that the quotation otherwise faithfully reproduces the quoted text.”) 


#### Page Navigation

At the top of the page for each chapter, there is a drop-down "Page Navigation" menu. Hovering over this will reveal a list of the page contents, and clicking on an item will scroll to the appropriate location on the page. On mobile devices, click on the menu icon (<img src="../img/menu.png" width="16">) to reveal the Page Navigation menu).

#### Sidenotes & Margin Notes{#notes}

Following the typographical style of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), this site uses sidenotes and margin notes in place of traditional footnotes or endnotes. These appear in the right-hand margin, avoiding the need to jump through hyperlinks or scroll to the note text. Numbered sidenotes[^sidenote] are used for footnotes in the source materials (with original note numbering indicated in parentheses). Unnumbered margin notes,[^marginnote] in <span class="sans-green">green sans-serif typeface</span>, are used for editor's comments. On mobile devices, sidenotes and margin notes may initially be hidden; clicking on the indicator for a sidenote (<span class="dullred">[1]</span>) or margin note (&#8853;) will reveal the note. 

[^sidenote]: This is an example of a sidenote. 

[^marginnote]: 
  {-} This is an example of a margin note.
