Akademick√Ω is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academic sites. It is based on [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), and uses elements from [clayh53/tufte-jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) (figures, and side/margin notes in the style of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and [andhart/bijou](https://github.com/andhart/bijou) (table and button styles). 

## Demos 

Here are two sites using this theme:
