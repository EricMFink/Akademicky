# Joinder of Indemnification & Contribution Claims 

FRCP Rules 13(g) and 14(a) both permit joinder of claims by a party seeking to hold someone else liable for all or part of a claim against them: 

### Rule 13(g)

> [A] crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.

### Rule 14(a) 

> A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it.

These provisions refer to claims for _indemnification_ and _contribution_. These are derivative claims, i.e. they are based on the claimant's own liability to another party ("primary claimant"). An indemnification or contribution claim seeks recovery of all (indemnification) or part (contribution) of the amount paid to the primary claimant from someone else. 

Where a party seeks indemnification or contribution from a co-party already in the case, the claim is joined as a crossclaim under Rule 13(g). 

Where a party seeks indemnification or contribution from someone who is not already a party in the case, the additional party and the claim against them are joined under Rule 14(a). The newly-added party is referred to as a _third-party defendant,_ and the party asserting the indemnification or contribution claim (who may have entered the case originally as either a defendant or as a plaintiff against whom another party has asserted a counterclaim or crossclaim) as the _third-party plaintiff_. 

Under the FRCP, neither crossclaims and third-party claims are compulsory. Conseuently, a party with a potential contribution or indemnification claim (whether against a co-party or potential third-party) may opt to wait until the outcome of the suit and then bring the contribution/indemnification claim in a subsequent action. 

# Basis of Indemnification & Contribution Claims

Rules 13(g) and 14(a) do not establish a right to indemnification or contribution. That is a matter of substantive law (tort, contract, or statute). These Rules simply govern the procedure for joining such claims where they have some basis in substantive law. 

## Indemnification

A right to indemnification allows a defending party to recover the full amount of a judgment against them (and sometimes defense costs) from another person.  

Indemnification originated as a common law right, based on tort and agency law.  The common law right has been augmented (or in some jurisdictions replaced) by statutory and contractual rights to indemnification. 

### Common law indemnification

Common law indemnification applies where a defendant was not actually at fault, but is liable to the plaintiff for another person's conduct, based on their legal status or relationship. 

_Example:_ At common law, an employer held vicariously liable for harm to a third party cause by an employee could sue the employee for indemnification. In some states, this common law right to indemnification from employees has been abrogated by judicial opinion or statute. 

_Example: In some states, a retailer subject to strict liability for injuries caused by a defective product it sold has a common law right to indemnification by the manufacturer (or other party actually responsible for the defect), as long as the retailer was not itself also at fault. 

### Statutory indemnification

Indemnification statutes may codify the common law right or impose a duty to indemnify where it would not apply under common law. 

_Example:_ In some states, an employer has a statutory duty to indemnify an employee for any civil liability (including the cost of defense) arising from the employee's negligence in the course of employment. See, e.g., Cal. Labor Code § 2802(a).  

_Example:_ The business corporations statutes in every state include provisions that permit (subject to certain conditions or limits) corporations to indemnify corporate officers and directors (and sometimes other employees and agents) who are sued based on their corporate roles. Some state's business corporations statutes mandate indemnification of officers and directors who successfully defend against such claims. See, e.g., 8 Del. Code § 145; N.C.G.S. §§ 55-8-51, 55-8-52, & 55-8-56. You will learn more about statutory indemnification of directors and officers in your Business Organizations course.

### Contractual Indemnification 

Parties may enter into agreements that shift ultimate responsibility for judgments, without regard to which one is at fault. 

_Example:_ Many corporations enter into indemnification agreements with corporate officers and directors to provide indemnification (as authorized by statute). 

_Example:_ Manufacturers of consumer products may agree to indemnify distributors or retailers who face product liability suits. Such agreements may provide for indemnification where the common law right to indemnification does not apply or is not recognized at all under state law). You will learn more about products liability in your Torts class. 

Liability insurance is a common type of contractual indemnification agreement. Such policies typically provide that the insurance carrier will pay (subject to limits and conditions in the policy) the cost of judgments and the cost of defense for claims covered by the policy. 

## Contribution

A right of contribution allows a joint tortfeasor who pays damages beyond their proportionate share of fault (e.g. under joint and several liability) to seek reimbursement from other joint tortfeasors for their proportionate shares. The right of contribution may be governed by common law or statute. You will learn more about joint & several liability, and contribution among joint tortfeasers, in your Torts class.
