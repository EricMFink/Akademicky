# Order Granding Motion to Dismiss

This matter is before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Deutsch's Interpleader Action. Deutsch is currently in possession of a valuable sculpture and seeks equitable relief to determine ownership of the artwork. Defendants seek dismissal claiming an Interpleader Action is improper because the complaint fails to name two or more adverse claimants and this Court does not otherwise have jurisdiction.

# Background

Deutsch seeks to interplead a sculpture—[_Industrial Forms_ (aka _Auto Tower_)](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.141426.html)—by well known American artist John Storrs. She received the sculpture from the estate of her father who previously owned an art gallery in New York City. The ownership history of sculpture, while somewhat circuitous, is relevant to the motion.

In the late 1970's,[^1] John Storrs' estate (represented by his daughter, Monique Storrs Booz) consigned _Industrial Forms_ to the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery in New York City. The Schoelkopf Gallery maintained a long-term business relationship with the Storrs estate through this period, selling several of the artist's works.

In the summer of 1977, the Schoelkopf Gallery sent a letter to Monique Storrs Booz informing her that _Industrial Forms_ had been stolen. Schoelkpf enclosed payment for $2,250, the amount she would have received had the sculpture been sold (list price minus gallery commission). Records submitted to the Smithsonian Archives of American Art for preservation by the Schoelkopf Gallery show _Industrial Forms_ labeled as "stolen." In 1991, Robert Schoelkopf passed away, the Schoelkopf Gallery closed, and Andrew Schoelkopf—Robert's son—assumed control of the Gallery's outstanding art interests.

Deutsch's father owned the Sid Deutsch Gallery in New York City. He passed away in 2006. Deutsch inherited the sculpture from her father's estate and returned to Washington with it. Several years later, Deutsch contacted Valerie Carberry in an attempt to value and sell the sculpture. Carberry is a partner at the Richard Gray Gallery in Chicago that manages art for the Storrs estate. Carberry notified Michelle Storrs Booz, the last remaining heir of the Storrs estate, of Deutsch's sale inquiry. The pair concluded the sculpture went missing from the Schoelkopf Gallery and that Andrew Schoelkopf was the true owner by virtue of Robert's 1977 payment to Monique Storrs Booz.

In October 2015, Carberry wrote a letter to Deutsch on behalf of the Storrs Estate explaining that the sculpture had been previously been stolen and the Storrs Bozz family wished to restore it to the proper owners. Andrew sent Deutsch a letter confirming that Storrs Booz and Carberry agreed that he owns _Industrial Forms,_ and to make arrangements for its retrieval. Deutsch then brought this interpleader against the named defendants to resolve what she claims are competing interests. Deutsch claims she is the rightful owner of _Industrial Forms_ because there is not conclusive proof that it was stolen.


# Discussion

## A. Standard of Review

Interpleader is a procedure authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1335 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 22 that allows a party holding property to join in a single suit two or more defendant-claimants asserting mutually exclusive claims to the property. The main purpose of interpleader is to protect the stakeholder from the expenses of multiple lawsuits and from having to contend with inconsistent or multiple determinations of liability. While rule and statutory interpleader have different requirements for subject matter jurisdiction, venue, process service, invoking either type requires meeting certain criteria. Fed. R. Civ. P. 22(a)(1); 28 USC § 1335.

First, multiple adverse claims or potential adverse claims must be made to that same property. Additionally, the plaintiff stakeholder must have a reasonable fear of multiple liability. The stakeholder is not required to determine the validity of the competing claims or wait to be actually sued by one or more of the claimants. However, the stakeholder must have "a good faith belief that there are or may be colorable competing claims to the stake," based on "a real and reasonable belief."

An interpleader action proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, a court evaluates whether interpleader is proper based on the facts of the case, including determining whether the stakeholder actually faces or could face multiple adverse claims. If interpleader is not properly invoked, the action is dismissed. If (and only if) an interpleader is determined to be proper does a court move to the second stage to determine the merits of the adverse claims.

During the first phase, the party seeking interpleader bears the burden of demonstrating she is or may be subject to adverse claims. Adverse claims or potentially adverse claims exist when at least two defendants lay claim to the property held by the stakeholder. Sustaining an interpleader based on potential claims requires a "real and reasonable belief" that the interpleaded parties could have a colorable claim to the stake. 

## B. Deutsch has not shown sufficient adverse claims to invoke interpleader.

Deutsch's interpleader action necessarily depends on her claim that all of the named defendants possess adverse claims to the sculpture. But only Andrew Schoelkopf claims any interest in _Industrial Forms_—the other defendants all agree that Andrew is the only legitimate claimant, and each affirmatively renounces any claim. This leaves Andrew as the only _actual_ claimant to the sculpture. Deutsch cannot maintain her interpleader action based on current adverse claims.

Without presently adverse claims to the sculpture, the next issue is whether Deutsch can establish potentially adverse claimants. The potential claimants with a reasonable claim to the sculpture have submitted declarations to this Court. Michelle Storrs Booz, the Schoelkopf family, and Valerie Carberry reflect the parties known to have a potentially colorable claim to the sculpture that could be potentially adverse to Deutsch. Following John Storrs Booz's 2005 death, his sister, Michelle Storrs Booz is the sole John Storrs heir with any remaining interest in the sculpture according to her declaration. She renounced any claim to the sculpture on behalf of her father's estate. Andrew, Jane, and Robert J. Schoelkopf —the Robert Schoelkopf's heirs— all agree that Andrew is the only family member with a claim to the sculpture. Jane and Robert J. explicitly renounce any claim to the sculpture. Additionally, Valerie Carberry, the Chicago-based art dealer from the Richard Gray Gallery, makes no claim to the sculpture. 

Michelle Storrs Booz is the sole remaining heir of Storr's artwork. She has renounced any interest in the sculpture, and that precludes any potential future claim from the Storr's family. Similarly, Jane and Robert J.'s disavowal precludes any potential future claim from the Schoelkopfs. Carberry and the Gray Gallery renounce any future claim to the statute. Therefore, Deutsch cannot sustain the interpleader action based on potential adverse claimants.

In an effort to save her interpleader claim in the face of overwhelming evidence that there is only one actual or potential claimant, Deutsch next argues interpleader is proper based on alleged adversity at the time she filed this complaint. Once interpleader jurisdiction has been _properly established_ it will continue even if the original claimants are no longer adverse. As emphasized above, jurisdiction must first be properly established before it will continue in absence of adverse parties. Here, no adverse claims are present at the outset, therefore there is no jurisdiction. Deutsch filed her initial complaint on June 24, 2016. On May 17, 2016, Andrew Schoelkopf notified her in writing that the Storrs estate agreed he was the legitimate owner of the sculpture. At the outset of this action defendants all submitted declarations attesting to the lack of adversity before the court ruled on the existence of interpleader jurisdiction. Therefore, Deutsch cannot maintain her interpleader claim based on perceived adversity at the outset of her claim.

Therefore, defendants' motion is GRANTED and plaintiff's complaint and request for deposit is DISMISSED without prejudice.

It is so ordered.
