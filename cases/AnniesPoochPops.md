# Introduction

Pennsylvania law permits a prothonotary[^1] of any of its courts of common pleas[^2] to enter judgment by confession, in ministerial fashion, when a plaintiff files a complaint that, among other requisites, includes a copy of an instrument that the defendant has signed authorizing such judgment.

[^1]: (Editor's Note) "Prothonotary" is the title of the chief clerk in most Pennsylvania state courts. This is one of many quaint features of the Pennsylvania legal system, lending a Dickensian air to litigation in the Keystone State.

[^2]: (Editor's Note) The Courts of Common Pleas are the principal trial-level courts, analogous to the Superior Court in North Carolina.

In this case, confessed judgment was entered by the state court against Defendants, dog treat company Annie's Pooch Pops LLC, and its owner, Annie Hartig (hereinafter, "Annie's Pooch Pops"). The defendants removed the case, and filed a petition to strike or open the confessed judgment in this Court. Plaintiff Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc. seeks remand, and a stay of the litigation.

Because Annie's Pooch Pops has failed to demonstrate the requisite amount-in-controversy in this case, it has lost its bark. The Court will remand the case.


# Legal Standard

When confronted with a motion to remand, the removing party has the burden of establishing the propriety of removal. "[R]emoval statutes 'are to be strictly construed against removal, and all doubts resolved in favor of remand.'" Here, the contest lies in whether removing Defendants can prove the requisite amount-in-controversy sufficient to concretize their assertion of subject matter jurisdiction.

In 2011, Congress enacted a new Section 1446(c)(2) to the federal removal statute, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441, _et seq.,_ with the intent to clarify the determination of the amount-in-controversy in removal cases. Interpreting that legislative change in _Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens,_ 574 U.S. 81 (2014), the Supreme Court explained "If the plaintiff's complaint, filed in state court, demands monetary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted in good faith, is 'deemed to be the amount in controversy.' ยง 1446(c)(2). When the plaintiff's complaint does not state the amount in controversy, the defendant's notice of removal may do so. ยง 1446(c)(2)(A)." _Id._ at 84.

However, if the Court questions or the plaintiff contests the amount-in-controversy asserted by the removing defendant, the parties must put on evidence, and the defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount-in-controversy is met. In making this determination, the Court generally looks to the complaint, but can look to other proofs. 

# Discussion

## I. The parties' respective arguments.

The dispute hinges on the defendant's assertion concerning attorneys' fees. As an initial note, attorneys' fees may be considered as part of the amount-in-controversy if available to plaintiff's under their cause of action, and the parties agree that Complete Business Group may seek attorneys' fees under Pennsylvania law. _See_ Pa. R. Civ. P. 2957(a) ("Plaintiff may include the amount due, interest, attorneys' fees and costs in the praecipe[^3] for writ of execution under Rule 2963(5).").

[^3]: (Editor's note) As used in Pennsylvania civil practice, "Praecipe" is an ornate synonym for "motion".

The parties' dispute centers on whether the value of the attorneys' fees is speculative or not. Annie's Pooch Pops specifically contends that the amount-in-controversy is met because Complete Business Group has left the question of fees open in its complaint, and because they believe, in good faith, that the litigation will develop in such a way that fees will inevitably reach the threshold requirement. Complete Business Group emphatically asserts that it has specifically averred the amount-in-controversy in the amount of $41,371.78. Because its fees are static, any additional right to fees is based on future events not yet knowable at the time of the filing of the complaint or removal.


## II. Annie's Pooch Pops have not met their burden.

Annie's Pooch Pops have not met their burden in showing the amount-in-controversy meets the federal requirement. While Complete Business Group reserves the right to pursue attorneys' fees should Defendants challenge the confessed judgment, ultimately, the Court is left to guess, one way or another, as to whether the amount-in-controversy will reach the required minimum. Indeed, the Court has no basis, nor has Annie's Pooch Pops provided one,[^4] for the expectation that the amount-in-controversy will have almost doubled from Complete Business Group's current monetary demand of about $41,000, or in other words, the attorneys' fees will be valued at almost the same value of that present demand. Because the Court must rely on such guesswork, Annie's Pooch Pops cannot establish federal subject matter jurisdiction.

[^4]: (n.4 in original) Defendants argue that the scorched-earth litigation practices of Fox Rothschild, Plaintiff's counsel, in similar cases where defense counsel is also counsel for the opposing parties, dictates that fees will be exorbitant in _this_ case. Annie's Pooch Pops also contends that this case will be of such complexity and scope that the fees will surpass the federal threshold easily. Yet, these arguments are too speculative for the Court to determine now, that in fact, such proposed realities will come to pass.

# Conclusion

For these reasons, the Court will remand the case. [ * * * ]
