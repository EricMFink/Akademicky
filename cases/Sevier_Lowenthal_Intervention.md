# Memorandum Opinion 

Plaintiff Chris Sevier,[^1] proceeding _pro se,_ seeks the removal of "the Gay Pride Rainbow Colored Flag" from "the halls and public access way[s] of Federal legislative buildings." "[H]omosexuality," he says, "is a religion," which the public display of the gay pride flag impermissibly favors. According to Sevier, display of the flag violates the Establishment Clause, discourages him from lobbying Congress, and violates his rights to equal protection and substantive due process. Sevier has made similar claims in, by his count, "more than [fifteen]" other lawsuits. In addition, Sevier asks that the Court "declare that the holdings in _United States v. Windsor,_ ... and _Obergefell v. Hodges,_ ... are intellectually dishonest and amount to acts of judicial tyranny and judicial malpractice." 

Currently pending before the Court are Defendants' motion to dismiss,[^2] Sevier's motion for leave to amend his complaint, a motion to intervene, and numerous other motions. For the reasons explained below, the Court [ … ] will DENY the motion to intervene [ … ].

# I. Background

Sevier's complaint consists largely of his views regarding homosexuality and criticisms of the Supreme Court's _Obergefell_ decision. It also recounts Sevier's efforts to "put[] [_Obergefell_] to the test" by marrying inanimate objects. The present action appears to focus, however, on the following allegations: Defendants, who are four members of the U.S. House of Representatives, have allegedly "authorized and installed [one or more] Gay Pride Rainbow Colored Flag[s]" in the hallways outside their offices, which Sevier "frequently encounter[s]". Given Sevier's "religious worldview" that "homosexuality is obscene, immoral, [and] subversive to human flourishing," he "[i]s offended by [the flags'] presence". The flags, he says, make him "feel[] unwelcome[]," because he does not "adhere to [Defendants'] particular religious orthodoxy".

The "religious ideology" that Sevier has in mind is homosexuality itself. He contends that "the [h]omosexual church" is "the largest denomination" of "the overall church of western expressive individualism postmodern moral relativism," which posits that "nobody's version of morality as a basis of law matters except for the private moral code that [the adherent] personally advocat[es]," In Sevier's view, then, the gay pride flag "is a `religious symbol' for the homosexual denomination," and its "placement ... amounts to [Defendants'] endorsement of a particular religion".

The public display of these flags, moreover, allegedly "treats different sects within the church of moral relativism with different degrees of favorability." Sevier says he belongs to "a less popular sect" of the church of moral relativism, which he calls the "machinist sect[]". As a "machinist," Sevier's "sex-based self-asserted identity narrative is that he prefers to be married to an inanimate object." So, according to Sevier, unless Defendants "install a flag that represents people who self-identify as polygamists, machinists, zoophiles, and heterosexuals," their actions "treat ... the homosexual denomination of ... the church of moral relativism with disproportionate favor".

Based on these allegations, Sevier alleges violations of the Establishment, Equal Protection, and Due Process clauses. He seeks an injunction requiring that Defendants remove the flags, or, in the alternative, "fly the [f]lags that represent the people in the zoophile, polygamy, and machinism sects [of] the overall church of moral relativism." He also seeks declaratory judgments that (1) Defendants' display of the flags "is unconstitutional;" (2) that _Obergefell_ and _Windsor_ are "intellectually dishonest ... acts of judicial tyranny and judicial malpractice;" and (3) that "homosexuality is a `religion'... [that the] government cannot legally recognize."

Sevier's initial lawsuit was filed on March 23, 2017, he filed a motion for summary judgment. On August 15, 2017, John Gunter Jr., Whitney Kohl, and Joan Grace Harley — "three self-identified polygamists" who appear to be coordinating with Sevier in this and other cases — moved to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), or alternatively, to intervene permissively under Rule 24(b)(1)(B). Gunter, Kohl, and Harley allege Equal Protection, Due Process, and Establishment Clause claims that are similar in form to those advanced by Sevier, although their allegations of injury focus even more on their opposition to gay marriage generally and their "feel[ing] deeply offended" by "[t]he Defendants['] display of the gay pride flag for self-serving political reasons." 

On September 22, 2017, Defendants—four members of the House of Representatives who have displayed the flags outside their offices—moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on the grounds that Sevier lacks standing and that the case presents a nonjusticiable political question; under Rule 12(b)(5) for insufficient service of process; and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. They ask also that the Court treat their motion to dismiss as an opposition to the motion to intervene and Sevier's motion for summary judgment. Because Defendants' motion raises a number of threshold issues, the Court denied Sevier's motion for summary judgment as premature, and ordered him to respond to Defendants' motion to dismiss. Instead, he filed two "affidavits" in support of his complaint. Then, on October 2, 2017, he moved to stay these proceedings pending the resolution of his motion to intervene in _Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission,_ a case currently before the Supreme Court. The Court denied that motion, and Sevier continued to file affidavits in support of his complaint. On October 7, 2017, Sevier filed a "motion for the court to make an expedited ruling on the intervention motion." Although not styled as such, this document responds to the arguments made in Defendants' motion to dismiss.

# II. Legal Standard

[ * * * ]

## B. Motion to Intervene Under Rule 24

Parties seeking to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) must comply with four requirements. First, "the application to intervene must be timely." Second, "the applicant must demonstrate a legally protected interest in the action." Third, "the action must threaten to impair that interest." Fourth, "no party to the action can be an adequate representative of the applicant's interests." A movant seeking to intervene as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a) must also possess Article III standing.

"Permissive intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that ... [`]the court may permit anyone to intervene who ... has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.'" "In order to litigate a claim on the merits" under Rule 24(b), "the putative intervenor must ordinarily present: (1) an independent ground for subject matter jurisdiction; (2) a timely motion; and (3) a claim or defense that has a question of law or fact in common with the main action." "In exercising its discretion" regarding permissive intervention, the Court "must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights." Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). "[P]ermissive intervention is an inherently discretionary enterprise," and district courts are afforded "wide latitude" in determining whether a third-party should be permitted to intervene.

## B. Remaining Motions

[ * * * ]

### 1. Motion to Intervene and Motion for Summary Judgment

A proposed intervenor under Rule 24(a) must first demonstrate Article III standing. Here, Gunter, Kohl, and Harley have primarily argued that the message of the gay pride flag is "an oppressive and offensive religious symbol," and reiterated Sevier's objections to _Obergefell_. The former is the sort of generalized offense that does not constitute an injury for purposes of an Establishment Clause claim. The latter allegations, as noted above, are unrelated to any particular injury identified by Gunter, Kohl, and Harley, and thus fail to establish standing.

The strongest case for standing rests on Gunter's single, unsupported statement that "[h]e is a D.C. lobbyist," and the proposed intervenors' suggestion that they do not "feel welcomed or comfortable walking the halls of the legislative buildings with the gay pride rainbow colored flags on display," _id._ at 23. These assertions are less detailed than those made by Sevier, whose argument for standing at least alleged personal contact with the flags in question. The lack of any further detail regarding interactions with the flags at issue, or past lobbying or legislative efforts, combined with the proposed intervenors stating that they live in Utah, not Washington, D.C., +leaves the Court without any basis to conclude that they have alleged facts sufficient to establish standing to sue. Moreover, unlike Sevier, their motion places its heaviest emphasis on grievances that are substantially more generalized, including opposition to homosexuality, gay rights, and — again — the _Obergefell_ decision. Taken together, the Court concludes that Gunter, Kohl, and Harley have failed to establish that they possess Article III standing to challenge the display of the flags displayed by Defendants.

Even if the proposed intervenors did have standing, however, the Court would still deny them leave to intervene. Gunter, Kohl, and Harley have advanced the same legal theories and arguments as Sevier, down to—frequently—the very wording of their motion to intervene and subsequent motions for summary judgment. In light of this congruence, the Court concludes that the proposed intervenors have failed to identify any way in which Sevier fails to represent their interests in this litigation. Absent such a showing, they are not entitled to intervene as of right.

That leaves the question whether permissive intervention is appropriate. "It remains... an open question in [the D.C.] Circuit whether Article III standing is required for permissive intervention." Because the legal theories advanced by the proposed intervenors are baseless, the Court need not reach that question and will, instead, use the "wide latitude" it enjoys in evaluating motions to intervene under Rule 24(b) to decline to allow the proposed intervenors to advance the same flawed arguments. The motions for summary judgment filed by two of the proposed intervenors must then also be denied, because they are not parties to this case.

For these reasons, the Court will [ … ] deny the motion to intervene [ … ].

A separate order will issue.

[^1]: Editor's Note: Sevier is a lawyer with a penchant for asserting unusual claims motivated by his opposition to what he believes is a ["social agenda to make America a 'gay nation.'"]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/materials/joinder/Sevier_MotionToIntervene.pdf). In 2011, the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility placed Sevier on [disability inactive status]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/materials/joinder/Sevier_Disability.pdf) “by reason of mental infirmity or illness”. This has not deterred Sevier from bringing numerous lawsuits, representing himself _pro se_.

	 Many of these suits have involved Sevier's relationship with his laptop computer. Sevier unsuccessfully sued Apple, Google, and various other defendants for failing to prevent him from viewing pornagraphy on the computer. [Sevier v. Apple](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7113307144877845212), No. 3:13-cv-00607, slip op. (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 13, 2015); [Sevier v. Google](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1351708446224227742), No. 3:14-01313, slip op. (M.D. Tenn. March 16, 2015). He then brought suits in multiple states asserting his desire to marry the computer. _See,_ _e.g.,_ [Sevier v. Thompson](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14131774103661851346), No. 2:16-cv-00659-DN., slip op. (D. Utah, March 16, 2018) (dismissing suit against Utah officials for refusal to issue marriage license); [Sevier v. Hickenlooper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14253040892261733642), Nos. 17-cv-1750-WJM-NYW, 17-cv-1666-WJM-NYW, slip op. (D. Colo. Jan. 18, 2018) (dismissing suit against Colorado officials for refusal to issue marriage license and against Masterpiece Cake Shop for refusal to provide a wedding cake); [Sevier v. Bevin](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12316423162168831762), No. 16-80-HRW, slip op. (E.D. Ky., March 31, 2017) (dismissing suit against Kentucky officials for refusal to issue marriage license), aff'd sub. nom. Sevier v. Davis, No. 17–5654, slip op. (6th Cir. Feb. 15, 2018). Gunter, Kohl, and Harley, the proposed intervenors here, were also involved in several of those cases. 

	After being rebuffed by the courts, Sevier has turned his attention toward the legislative branch, lobbying for state laws curtailing LGBTQ+ rights and requiring pornography filters on computers and telephones. _See_ Lara Korte & Jonathan Shorman, [Meet the man influencing state lawmakers across U.S. to file anti-gay, anti-porn bills](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article226297655.html), Kansas City Star (Feb. 19, 2019).
