# Order 

This state-law declaratory-judgment action tests whether the construction of a new cell tower must comply with an Ohio township’s zoning regulations.

Ohio law generally forbids townships to regulate cellular communications towers and other public utilities within their jurisdictions. O.R.C. § 519.211(A). But a township’s board of trustees may regulate the location and construction of a cell tower if: 1) either a trustee or a person who owns property neighboring the cell-tower site objects; and 2) the township notifies the person building the tower that it will subject the tower to its zoning regulations. O.R.C. §§ 519.211(B)(2), 519.211(B)(4)(a).

In 2015, defendant STC Towers, LLC, notified the Board of Trustees of Ottawa Township, Ohio, of its intent to construct a cell tower in one of the Township’s residential districts. (Upon completion of construction, STC will lease the tower to defendant New Par, d/b/a Verizon Wireless.).

The Trustees objected to the proposed construction and so notified STC in writing, but STC proceeded with construction.

STC took the position that the Trustees’ written objection was invalid under O.R.C. § 519.211(B)(4)(a). That provision requires that “the fiscal officer of the township send the person proposing to construct the tower written notice that the tower is subject to” the Township’s zoning code. _Id._ Because the Trustees themselves—rather than the Township’s fiscal officer—had issued the notice, STC asserted that the Trustees had no power to regulate the placement or construction of the tower. 

In January, 2017, the Trustees sued New Par in the Putnam County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas. Their complaint sought an order requiring that New Par “compl[y] with the Ottawa Township Zoning Resolution” and precluding defendants “from continuing the construction” of the cell tower.

Rather than answer the complaint or file a responsive pleading, New Par removed the case to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.

After I granted New Par’s motion to join STC as a necessary party, the defendants counterclaimed against the Trustees. They alleged that the Trustees’ attempt to regulate the construction of the cell tower: 1) is ultra vires as a matter of Ohio law; 2) violates the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in particular 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B); and 3) tortiously interferes with their business. New Par and STC seek money damages and a declaratory judgment that the Trustees have no power under Ohio law to regulate the cell tower.

Pending is the Trustees’ motion to remand the case to state court.

They contend that the case does not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement because their complaint seeks no monetary damages, only declaratory relief. The Trustees also argue that I may not consider the damages that defendants seek by way of counterclaim (allegedly in excess of $250,000) when determining the amount in controversy. 

For the reasons that follow, I agree that the defendants’ counterclaim damages do not count toward the amount-in-controversy requirement. But the record is currently insufficient to determine whether the value of the declaratory relief that the Trustees seek exceeds $75,000. Accordingly, I will hold the remainder of the motion in abeyance pending further submissions from the parties.

# Discussion

“[A]ny civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.” 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).

District courts have original jurisdiction over civil cases between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy, exclusive of costs and interest, exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1).

In cases that a defendant has removed from state court, “[t]he existence of subject matter jurisdiction is determined by examining the complaint as it existed at the time of removal.” _Harper v. AutoAlliance Int’l, Inc.,_ 392 F.3d 195, 210 (6th Cir. 2004). “The burden of showing that the district court has original jurisdiction is on the party seeking removal.” _Long v. Bando Mfg. of Am., Inc.,_ 201 F.3d 754, 757 (6th Cir. 2000).

## A. Defendants’ Counterclaim Damages

Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has decided whether a defendant’s counterclaim damages count toward the amount-in-controversy requirement. _See_ _CMS N. Am., Inc. v. De Lorenzo Marble & Tile, Inc.,_ 521 F. Supp. 2d 619, 622–24 (W.D. Mich. 2007) (canvassing Supreme Court and Circuit authority).

As some district courts have noted, however, the Sixth Circuit has “referred approvingly to the traditional rule that ‘no part of the required jurisdictional amount can be met by considering a defendant’s counterclaim to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement for removal jurisdiction purposes.’ ” _Firestone Fin. Corp. v. Syal,_ 327 F. Supp. 2d 809, 811 (N.D. Ohio 2004) (Wells, J.) (_quoting_ _Sanford v. Gardenour,_ 225 F.3d 659, *3 (6th Cir. 2000) (unpublished)).

Ultimately, the Circuit decided the Sanford case on the ground that the plaintiffs admitted that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, so its endorsement in dicta of the “traditional rule” is just one piece of persuasive authority to weigh, rather than binding authority to follow.

At the district-court level, “the majority of Sixth Circuit district courts to confront the question have held that counterclaims should not be considered when determining the amount in controversy for purposes of removal jurisdiction[.]” _Total Quality Logistics, LLC v. AD Maxx, Inc.,_ 2016 WL 6070356, *2 (S.D. Ohio) (internal quotation marks omitted).

These cases make three points that persuade me that I ought not consider the defendants’ counterclaim damages in deciding the amount in controversy.

First, because removal jurisdiction is a creature of statute rather than based in the Constitution, courts construe removal jurisdiction narrowly. See _Shamrock Oil Corp. v. Sheets,_ 313 U.S. 100, 107–09 (1941). Such construction is necessary, in particular, to avoid impinging on the right of the State courts to adjudicate cases within their jurisdictions. _Joseph v. Baxter Int’l, Inc_., 614 F. Supp. 2d 868, 871 (N.D. Ohio 2009) (“removal jurisdiction raises significant concerns about federalism”). By excluding counterclaim damages, the class of removable cases remains smaller.

Second, this approach is consistent with the rule that a defendant cannot remove a case to federal court on the basis of a defense or counterclaim that arises under federal law. _Holmes Grp., Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys.,_ Inc., 535 U.S. 826, 830–31 & n.2 (2002).

Third, it also comports “with the well-pleaded-complaint rule, which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff[’s] properly pleaded complaint. The competing approach of not requiring the jurisdictional amount to be met in the complaint flies in the face of the ... rule.” _Energy Concepts, LLC v. Direct Capital Corp.,_ 2015 WL 1648900, *3 (M.D. Tenn.).

I therefore hold that a defendants’ counterclaim damages cannot satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. But even assuming that counterclaim damages could count toward the amount in controversy, I would not be able to consider STC and New Par’s damages in any event.

As already noted, courts determine the existence of jurisdiction at the time of removal. _Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust,_ 463 U.S. 1, 10 (1983).

Here, STC and New Par did not file their counterclaim until after they removed the case to federal court. Accordingly, “considering the damages sought by the counterclaim ... would violate the rule that whether an action could have been brought in federal court originally is determined by the amount in controversy at the time of removal.” _CMS N. Am.,_ 521 F. Supp. 2d at 629 (internal quotation marks omitted).

For these reasons, defendants’ counterclaim damages cannot and do not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.2

## B. Value of Declaratory Relief

“In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.” _Freeland v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,_ 632 F.3d 250, 253 (6th Cir. 2011). “[W]here a party seeks a declaratory judgment, the amount in controversy is not necessarily the money judgment sought or recovered, but rather the value of the consequences which may result from the litigation.” _Id._

The Trustees contend that their complaint “does not put any amount in controversy” because it “does not seek monetary damages.” That argument doesn’t hold much water, given cases like _Freeland_.

In their reply brief, the Trustees contend that “the object of the ... litigation ... is to require compliance with Ottawa Township’s Zoning Resolution—a procedure which should not cost the Defendants anywhere near $75,000.” But the Trustees provide no explanation—let alone evidence—to support their position that the cost of complying with the proposed declaratory judgment is $75,000 or less.

The defendants contend that “the construction of the wireless telecommunications facility itself is valued in excess of $250,000 and the damages that will be or have been incurred by the Defendants as a result of the Plaintiff’s conduct go upwards from there.”

This contention, which is both conclusory and non-responsive, likewise does not establish whether the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

A defendant that removes a case to federal court ordinarily “need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold,” but such an allegation will not suffice if “questioned by the court.” _Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens,_ 135 S. Ct. 547, 554 (2014).

“When the amount in controversy is questioned, the defendant must provide evidence to support its allegation that the lawsuit involves an amount in controversy meeting the jurisdictional threshold.” _Dykema v. Jo–Ann Stores, LLC,_ 2016 WL 2752891, *2 (W.D. Mich.). The defendant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the case satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement. _Northrup Props., Inc. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C.,_ 567 F.3d 767, 769–70 (6th Cir. 2009).

I question the defendants’ allegation, principally because it identifies only the value of their construction project, rather than the cost of making that project comply with the Township zoning code.

The Trustees seek a declaratory judgment that the defendants must construct the cell tower in compliance with the Township’s zoning code. Accordingly, the “value of the object of litigation” would seem to be the costs that the defendants will incur to comply with that code—whether in the form of additional expenses to retrofit whatever portion of the tower is currently complete or to redesign the tower from scratch, the loss in value, if any, of a tower that must comply with the Township’s regulations when compared to a tower that does not so comply, the sunk costs if the tower project cannot go forward, and the like.

Because the record is silent on these issues, the parties must submit additional briefs and supporting evidence so that I can determine whether this court has subject-matter jurisdiction.

# Conclusion

It is, therefore,

ORDERED THAT:

1. The parties are directed to submit additional briefs and supporting evidence on the question whether the value of the object of litigation exceeds $75,000;
2. Defendants’ submission due on or before July 31, 2017; plaintiff’s responsive submission due on or before August 21, 2017; and defendants’ reply, if any, due on or before August 31, 2017; and
3. Further proceedings held in abeyance pending submissions from the parties and adjudication of the motion to remand.

So ordered.[^1]
