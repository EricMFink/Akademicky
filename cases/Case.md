These consolidated cases{% marginnote "margin-note-id" "The Court's opinion involved two cases raising the same issue under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. One case, _Rosario Ortega v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc._ (Case No. 04-79 referenced in the introduction to the opinion), involved a young girl who was severely injured by a sharp edge on a tuna fish can. The other, _Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxon Corp._ (Case No. 04-70 referenced in the introduction to the opinion), was a class action suit by gas station owners who alleged that Exxon Corp. had breached their dealer agreements by overcharging them for fuel purchases. That portion of the opinion is omitted here." %} present the question whether a federal court in a diversity action may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional plaintiffs whose claims do not satisfy the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the claims are part of the same case or controversy as the claims of plaintiffs who do allege a sufficient amount in controversy. Our decision turns on the correct interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 1367. The question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam dolor dui, cursus sit amet bibendum sit amet, tristique in turpis. Morbi eget ullamcorper odio, eu dignissim dui. Donec vel metus rutrum, bibendum ex aliquet, facilisis leo.

We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, § 1367 does authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the jurisdictional amount specified in the statute setting forth the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in No. 04-70, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in No. 04-79.

In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit took a different position on the meaning of § 1367(a). In that case, a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking damages for unusually severe injuries she received when she sliced her finger on a tuna can. Her family joined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional distress and certain medical expenses. The District Court granted summary judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the plaintiffs met the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, however, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family members, had made allegations of damages in the requisite amount.

The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light of the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs' claims was proper under § 1367. The court held that § 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only when the district court has original jurisdiction over the action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdiction is lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.
