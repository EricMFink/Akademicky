# Problem 1

Andrea and Bart (both domiciled in NC) own neighboring homes. There is a gap in the fence separating their property. Bart's pet pig has repeatedly slipped through the gap and bathed in a creek that runs through Andrea's property, fouling the creek with its droppings. After this happens for the tenth time, an enraged Andrea shoots and kills the pig. Hearing the shots, Bart rushes into Andrea's yard, tackles Andrea, and clobbers Andrea over the head with a garden shovel. 

Andrea sues Bart in federal court under the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA), a federal statute, seeking an injunction compelling Bart to clean up the creek (which would cost Bart approximately $5,000). Andrea also wishes to sue Bart for the cost of cleaning up the mess that Bart's pig left in the creek. In the same suit, Andrea also asserts a claim against Bart for assault, seeking $5,000 in damages for her resulting injuries. 

a) Is joinder of the assault claim proper under the FRCP and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction? 

Shortly before the creek-fouling incident, Bart hired Andrea (who is a renowned painter of livestock) to paint a portrait of his pet pig. Andrea completed the painting, but Bart has refused to pay the agreed-upon $75,000 commission price, because he is furious about the loss of his beloved pet. Andrea wants to include a claim for breach of contract in her RCRA suit against Bart. 

b) Is joinder of the breach of contract claim proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction?  

Assume that Andrea sues Bart, asserting only the RCRA and assault claims. Bart wishes to assert two counterclaims against Andrea: a claim for the loss Bart's pig (“Claim 1”), and a claim for damage to Bart's house that resulted when a tree in Andrea's yard fell and landed on Bart's roof (“Claim 2”). 

c) Is joinder of the counterclaims proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction? 

# Problem 2

Agnes (a citizen of Michigan) buys a new boat, and hires Belinda (a citizen of North Carolina) to transport it to a beach house that Agnes owns in North Carolina. While Belinda is en route, she in involved in a collision with Craig (a citizen of North Carolina), who is driving a brand new Cadillac. Craig and Belinda both sustain serious injuries in the collision, and both of their vehicles, along with the boat, are totaled. 

Under the applicable state law, if Belinda's negligence was responsible (solely or in part) for the accident, she would be liable both to Craig for his injuries and the damage to his car, and to Agnes for the damage to her boat. Agnes would also be vicariously liable to Craig for Belinda's negligence, because Belinda was acting as an agent for Agnes at the time of the accident. If Craig's negligence was responsible (solely or in part) for the accident, he would be liable to Belinda for her injuries and the damage to her vehicle, and to Agnes for the damage to her boat. The law also provides for a right of contribution among joint tortfeasors in proportion to their respective degrees of fault. 

Agnes sues Craig in federal court, seeking $100,000 for the damage to her boat, which she alleges was caused by Craig's negligence. Craig denies that he was negligent, and alleges that the accident was caused instead by Belinda's negligence. Craig impleads Belinda as a third-party defendant, seeking contribution for Belinda's share of liability to Agnes for the damage to her boat, and also seeking $70,000 for Craig's own injuries and the damage to his car. 

a) Is joinder proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction?

Assume that, instead of Agnes initiating the lawsuit, Craig does so by suing Agnes & Belinda in federal court, seeking more than $75,000 against them, jointly and severally, for his personal injuries and the damage to his car. 

b) Is joinder of Agnes & Belinda as co-defendants proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction? 

Based on an investigation following the accident, Craig concludes that the brakes in his Cadillac were defective, and that this defect contributed to the accident. Under the applicable state law, General Motors (a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business is Michigan), which manufactured the car, is liable for any injuries or damage caused by the defect. When Craig files his suit, he names General Motors as a co-defendant along with Agnes, but he opts not to sue Belinda. 

c) Is the joinder of Agnes & General Motors as co-defendants proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction. 

Assume Agnes & General Motors are properly joined as co-defendants. Agnes then asserts two claims against General Motors: (1) for contribution on Craig's claim, and (2) for the damage to Agnes's boat. 

d) Is joinder of these claims proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction? 

# Problem 3

Arnold (a citizen of California) visits his primary care physician, Dr. Bonebreaker (also a citizen of California) for a routine checkup. Dr. Bonebreaker is concerned that a growth on Arnold's shoulder may be cancerous. She refers Arnold to the Cancer Clinic (incorporated and having its sole place of business in Nevada) for a consultation with Dr. Derma, a prominent skin cancer specialist employed by the Clinic. Dr. Derma performs a biopsy, which reveals that the growth is benign. A very relieved Arnold returns home to California. A few days later, he develops a noticeable and painful inflammation in his shoulder, and a high fever. He again visits Dr. Bonebreaker, who determines that the site of the biopsy has become infected. Prescribing an antibiotic, Dr. Bonebreaker assures Arnold that this is not uncommon after a biopsy, and that the problem should subside in a few days. Two weeks later, the swelling and fever having grown worse, Arnold is rushed to the hospital where he is treated for a nearly-fatal staph infection that has spread to his heart and lungs. 

Arnold sues the Cancer Clinic in federal court, alleging that the infection resulted from negligent treatment by the Clinic's employee, Dr. Derma. Arnold seeks a total of $1 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The Clinic contends that Dr. Bonebreaker was negligent in misdiagnosing the infection and failing to prescribe a more aggressive treatment, and that Bonebreaker was thus to blame for the harm Arnold suffered. The Clinic impleads Dr. Bonebreaker, asserting a claim for contribution in the event that the Clinic is found liable to Arnold. 

a) Is joinder of Dr. Bonebreaker proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction over the Clinic's claim against Dr. Bonebreaker?

After the Clinic impleads Dr. Bonebreaker, Arnold asserts a claim against Dr. Bonebreaker, asserting that her negligence in misdiagnosing the infection and failing to prescribe a more aggressive treatment contributed to Arnold's worsening condition. 

b) Is joinder of Arnold's claim against Bonebreaker proper under the FRCP, and if so, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction. 

Prior to filing his lawsuit, Arnold visited a website called RateYourDoctor.com, leaving a comment stating that "Dr. Bonebreaker is a total quack. Thanks to her incompetence, I contracted a serious infection and nearly died. Don't go to her for treatment unless you want to walk out worse off than when you walked in." After the Clinic impleads Dr. Bonebreaker, she asserts a claim against Arnold for defamation. 

c) Is joinder of this claim proper under the FRCP, and if so, does the court have subject matter jurisdiction?
